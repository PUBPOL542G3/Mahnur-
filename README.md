# Mahnur
This folder contains a tutorial on reshaping and cleaning data using the Python language in Jupyter Notebook.

This folder contains the following files:

1. Mahnur Raw.xlsx
2. mahnurcleanedfile.xlsx
3. mahnurcleaningcode.html
4. mahnurcleaningcode.ipynb

Mahnur Raw. xlsx is a raw data file that I imported to the jupyter notebook file "mahnurcleaningcode.ipynb" to clean. The "mahnurcleanedfile.xlsx" is the final, clean and reformatted output. I also included an html version of the .ipynb file.
